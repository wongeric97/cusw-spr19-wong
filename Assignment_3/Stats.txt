What case study area did you pick and why?
	I picked Hong Kong as my case study area as it's where my family is originally from.

What metrics did you pick and why?
	I decided to find information on Hong Kong about it's population, their average monthly income, and the economics of their
	housing situation. I choose these because I know that Hong Kong has the most expensive real estate market in the world
	but I wanted to see what that actually meant in terms of affordability for the people there, specifically how much of their
	salary did they need to dedicate to housing based on the different districts of Hong Kong. All of the census data was gathered 
	from data.hk.gov and shapefiles from geodata.mit.edu

What statistical test did you use and why?
	I tried to find if there is a correlation between the variance seen in a district's spread of monthly income with the spread of
	housing financing situations. I did so by calculating the variance in each district for the two sets of data and then the correlation
	between the two resulting arrays. I did this to see if the types of housing financial situations matched the types of incomes that 
	a district saw.

What was it's result (again not graded for accuracy)?
	The result was a very low correlation value of 0.035.
