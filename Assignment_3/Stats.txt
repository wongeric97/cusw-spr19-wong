What case study area did you pick and why?
	I picked Hong Kong as my case study area as it's where my family is originally from.

What metrics did you pick and why?
	I decided to find information on Hong Kong about it's population, their average monthly income, and the economics of their
	housing situation. I choose these because I know that Hong Kong has the most expensive real estate market in the world
	but I wanted to see what that actually meant in terms of affordability for the people there, specifically how much of their
	salary did they need to dedicate to housing based on the different districts of Hong Kong.

What statistical test did you use and why?
	I used a linear regression 

What was it's result (again not graded for accuracy)?
